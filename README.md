# gears-contributions
This repository contains world and robot designs for GearsBot (https://github.com/QuirkyCort/gears) that are not suitable for inclusion in the main repository.
This may include designs meant to demonstrate a particular feature in Gears or designs which have a very limited use case.

Some of the designs here may be contributed by others. Please check the individual directories for credits and license info.

Where image or model resources are required in the world configuration, they will be modified to use the copy on the github page of this repository.
